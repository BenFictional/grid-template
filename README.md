## How to download files

3. Unzip the file on your computer by double-clicking (OSX), or right-clicking and selecting "Extract all" (Windows).
4. Copy the contents of the "landing-page" folder to your local-directory folder.

## File Structure
The sample project includes one HTML file called "index.html" and a folder called "css" that contains "styles.css" and "grid.css"

CSS properties can be included in the <head> section of a single html page, but it's common practice to place all the CSS in a separate file to keep things organized. For this template the properties governing the grid structure are placed in "grid.css"â€”which you shouldn't edit unless you are confident in your ability to create a new grid structure.

**Place your custom CSS for fonts, colors, etc. in "styles.css"**

Open the HTML file in a web browser and in Brackets, to examine the structure of the website and how it is defined in the code.

* There are extensive comments to help you find your way around (comments will appear grey in Brackets)
* The grid layout uses the modern CSS property `display: flex` to arrange columns within rows. Read more about it [here](https://css-tricks.com/snippets/css/a-guide-to-flexbox/) if you're curious.
* When the browser is resized to below 600px wide, all the columns will occupy the full width of the screen. This is a pretty common technique for displaying content on mobile devices.
