## File Structure
The sample project includes one HTML file called "index.html" and a folder called "css" that contains "styles.css" and "grid.css"

CSS properties can be included in the <head> section of a single html page, but it's common practice to place all the CSS in a separate file to keep things organized. For this template the properties governing the grid structure are placed in "grid.css"â€”which you shouldn't edit unless you are confident in your ability to create a new grid structure.

**Place your custom CSS for fonts, colors, etc. in "styles.css"**

Open the HTML file in a web browser and in Brackets, to examine the structure of the website and how it is defined in the code.

* There are extensive comments to help you find your way around (comments will appear grey in Brackets)

* The layout uses modern HTML5 declarations like <header> and a responsive Flexbox layout in an effort to teach current standards.
